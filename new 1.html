		<p><font face="Times new roman">Asian cuisine is a diverse type of food that represents the various countries that make up the continent. 
		It has a wide variety of flavors and ingredients, with staples such as rice, noodles, seafood, and vegetables. 
		Sharing food with others is common in Asian culture. Traditional cooking methods, such as grilling, stir-frying, and steaming,
		preserve the natural flavors of the food. Harmony and balance between flavors, textures, and colors are highly valued in Asian cuisine,
		producing visually appealing and delicious dishes.
		The art of preparing and sharing food is deeply rooted in Asian culture.</font></p>
